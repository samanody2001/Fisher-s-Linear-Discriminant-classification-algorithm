# Fisher-s-Linear-Discriminant-classification-algorithm
I designed a Fisher’s Linear Discriminant classification algorithm that can recognize
scanned images of the 10 digits (0 to 9).The images in
the “Train” folder used to train a classifier for each digit.The folder contains a file named “Training Labels.txt” which includes the labels
of the 2400 images in order. After I trained the classifiers, I tested each classifier using the images given
in the “Test” folder.I examined Fisher’s Linear Discriminant twice. Once without including a bias term
in each discriminant function and another using a bias term for each discriminant function.
For each time, I produced a confusion matrix as well as the accuracy of your classifier.
